# MemoryCardGame

This is the public repository for Dr Ticer's Object Oriented Programming in Java course.

### Getting Started

Since I didn't upload any of the build files onto Githubm, you'll need to build your own JavaFX project on your computer and drag in the files I included. 
- App.java can replace the App.java file that VSCode builds
- The memory cards can be placed in the resources directory. Please do not try and add the entire folder into resources, JavaFX does not like this. Instead, add them one by one into resources.
- PrimaryController.java can replace the one VSCode builds
Everything else should remain the same.
